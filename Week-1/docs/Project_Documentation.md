# Student Information System – Project Documentation

## Project Title
Student Information System (Week 1 – Java Basics)

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand Java programming fundamentals
by building a simple console-based application.

## Project Description
This is a menu-driven Java application that allows the user to manage
student information such as student ID, name, age, and contact details.
The program runs in the console and stores data using ArrayList.

## Features
- Add new student details
- View all students
- Menu-driven user interface
- Basic input validation

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JDK
- Scanner class
- ArrayList

## Concepts Covered
- Classes and Objects
- Variables and Data Types
- Conditional Statements
- Loops
- User Input using Scanner
- Collections (ArrayList)

## How the Program Works
1. The program displays a menu to the user
2. User selects an option
3. Based on the option, the program performs an action
4. Data is stored temporarily using ArrayList
5. Output is displayed in the console

## Conclusion
This project helped in understanding basic Java concepts and how to
structure a simple Java application. It also improved problem-solving
and logical thinking skills.
